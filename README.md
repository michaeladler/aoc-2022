## Notes

### Day 7

Quite uncomfortable to do in Rust due to parent relationship (hello `LinkedList`!).

### Day 11

Beautiful puzzle!

### Day 16

First tricky puzzle this year. Initial (naive) solution for part 1 took ~24 seconds to compute the answer. The optimized version
(different algorithm) runs in just ~300 ms.
