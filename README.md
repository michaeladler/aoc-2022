## Hardest Problems

So far:

1. Day 16
2. Day 19
3. Day 17
4. Day 22

## Notes

### Day 7

Quite uncomfortable to do in Rust due to parent relationship (hello `LinkedList`!).

### Day 11

Beautiful puzzle!

### Day 16

First tricky puzzle this year. Initial (naive) solution for part 1 took ~24 seconds to compute the answer. The optimized version
(different algorithm) runs in just ~300 ms.

### Day 17

Part 2 is quite tricky as well but it's a beautiful puzzle.

### Day 19

Similar to day 16, also hard. Part 2 was rather unusual for AoC but actually quite interesting.

### Day 21

Funniest plot twist ever! Nice puzzle.

### Day 22

Ended up hard-coding the wrapping logic... very ugly but it works.

### Day 23

Much easier than previous days. We're coming to the end.

### Day 24

Great puzzle! Took me a while to realize that you cannot stay at the current position if a blizzard wants to take your
position in the next round.
